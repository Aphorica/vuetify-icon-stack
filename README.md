## Overview

Extremely light implementation of an icon stack.

Each icon is associated with a state.  When a state is
subsequently set, the associated icon becomes visible and
clickable.

Stack order does not change, only button visibility changes.

Clicking on the icon returns the associated state with
the visible icon.
